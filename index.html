          <h2 class="cardheading">Music & Sound Design</h2>
          <p>My education background is in audio production for visual media. That's a mouthful but basically I have learned to produce music and sound design for film and games. In my free time I mostly produce electronic music and play guitar. My dream is to one day create immersive audio visual experiences, merging what I love about non-linear adaptive video game soundtracks and linear live performances.</p>

          <h2 class="cardheading">Surfing</h2>
          <p>Growing up on the central coast of california, I was fortunate to learn to surf and explore pristine coastlines from an early age. With that said, it was the first thing I was passionate about, and is one of the main things that keeps me inspired and energized. In the photo above I was lucky to find uncrowded waves all the way in remote Indonesia with my Dad.</p>

          <p>One of my favorite places in the world, though slightly biased, is where I grew up. The central coast of california is a true gem, and has some of the last remaining coastal zip codes where you don't have to worry about traffic and air quality. Five minutes in any direction and you are bound to find a hike, the beach, or a forest. Although it has greatly grown in the past several years and is bound to continue growing, this is a place where I too hope to raise kids one day and show them why I fell in love with this place.</p>

          <h2 class="cardheading">Why Software Engineering</h2>
          <p>Through my time studying music production for visual media, one thing that I especially got excited about, was creating new ways of experiencing audio-visual media. Whether its VR/AR, interactive media exhibits in museums, or even music festivals, there's part of me that's drawn to exploring the more technical side of things in the name of expanding my craft. Through this program I hope to build a foundational skillset, knowledge base, and network in software engineering in the hopes that I can marry it with my passion for music and audio.</p>
